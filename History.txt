    Bugs fixed:

    - the FILEOS field is displayed correctly now
    - all strings are converted to the OEM code page

    New features:

    - changed algorithm of selecting string information block:

      secondly string information block with the system default language
      (this is the Windows Explorer behavior)
    - the copyright '\A9' and registered trademark '\xAE' characters
      are replaced with "(C)" and "(R)" respectively
    - language information is displayed now
    - added support for VxD file subtype (which is device ID)
    - the plugin is removed from the internal editor menu

    Cosmetic changes:

    - "Creware FileVersionInfo v1.1" changed to "Version Info"
    - "CrFileVersionInfo" changed to "Version Info"
    - "Version flags" changed to "File flags"
    - file flags are not displayed if there are none of them
    - "OS flags" changed to "Operating system"
    - "Sub-type" changed to "File subtype"
    - file subtype names are displayed in the full form
    - changed positions of some fields 
    - CrFileVerInfo.txt replaced with file_id.diz
